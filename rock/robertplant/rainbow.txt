Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I found a lucky charm
I dressed it up with love
I crossed the seven seas to you
Will it be enough?
And I will be a rainbow
Oh, while your storm is gone
And I will bring the song for you
And I will carry on

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm reachin' for the stars
In the sky above
Oh, I will bring their beauty home
The colors of my love
And I will be a rainbow
Now your storm is gone
And I will bring my song to you
And I will carry on

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Love is enough
Though the world be a wind
Words have no voice, but the voice of complaint
My hands shall not tremble, my feet shall not falter
The voyage shall not weary, the fish shall not alter
Hmm, it's rainbow, oh it's rainbow
Oh, can't you see the eyes are the eyes of a lover

Pocket full of hearts
A world that's filled with love
A love that carries all before
The passion and the flood
I lie beneath the rainbow

Now your tears have gone
And I will sing my song for you
And I will carry on

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, baby, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
